# myredis
Simple redis-like in-memory database. This project is not meant to be a drop-in replacement for Redis. It is just for fun :)

# Quick Start
From the top-level directory of this project (which contains this file), run:

<pre>
npm install 
</pre>

Then, you only have to run the app.js:
<pre>
node[js] app.js
</pre>
